    <h1 style="text-align: center;">CSS</h1>
    <p style="font-size: x-large;">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation and styling of web
        pages written in HTML or XML. It provides a way to separate the presentation of a web page from its content,
        allowing for greater flexibility and control over the appearance of a website.

        CSS works by defining rules that apply to specific elements or groups of elements on a web page. These rules are
        then applied to the corresponding HTML elements when the web page is rendered in a web browser. CSS can be used
        to specify the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a web page, as well as provide animations and
        interactive effects.

        CSS is typically written in a separate file from the HTML document and is linked to the HTML using a
        <link> tag. It is designed to work in conjunction with HTML and is not a standalone language.

        In summary, CSS is used to control the visual appearance and layout of HTML and XML documents, making it an
        essential component of modern web design.
